It features many cool key bindings that enhance the quality of computer use. 
This repository includes many bash scripts that help increase the utility of the window manager. These include a script to dynamically change the wallpaper, a screen brightness changer, a battery reminder, and a 20-20-20 screen timer. 

All of these scripts have been intergrated into the config files with unique key bindings. 

Feel free to use this config file or any of the scripts for your use for the i3 windom manager.
